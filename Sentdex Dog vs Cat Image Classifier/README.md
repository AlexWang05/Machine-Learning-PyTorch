This is a neural network designed to classify images to Dog/Cat.

To try this out yourself:
1. Install required packages (os, opencv-python, numpy, tqdm, and torch)
2. Download the Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset from Microsoft here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765
3. Extract the PetImages folder in the same folder as the python file
4. Change line 10 "REBUILD_DATA = False" to "REBUILD_DATA = True"
5. If you want to re-run after processing the raw data, reset the REBUILD_DATA to False and only run the rest of the code.
